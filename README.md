# RamjetProfiler
A bare-bones custom profiler for Unity3d

Right now Code Injector is entirely based on: http://www.codersblock.org/blog//2014/06/integrating-monocecil-with-unity.html

Didn't continue this project as this cannot be used to profile any of Unity's unmanaged processes, just the managed side and project-specific scripts.

This project does show you how to take a Unity assembly and inject your own custom code into it.
